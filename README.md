## Description

Use React to create a candidate search site that calls the GitHub API and displays a brief description about them. The user then can either dismiss or save this candidate which will then present the next candidate. This is repeated until there are no candidates to displays which alerts the user. Then, they can go to the Potential Candidates page to see a table of the candidates they saved. From there, they can narrow the list to find the best candidate by pressing the reject button. The pictures below show the candidate search and potential candidates pages, respectively.

## Installation

A device that can be connected to the internet and can connect to the browser is required. 

## Usage

This project was used get a better understanding on how to use React; more specifically, how to use the react-router DOM library where when users want to go to a different page via the nav bar, it does not reload the page. In addition, I learned how to code in React using Typescript and learned more about how to use useState and useEffect hooks correctly.
